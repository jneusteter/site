# My Development Stack

## Desktop

- **Ubuntu 18.04**

  I have been a Linux user for more than a decade now for my main desktop OS. Over the years I have used Debian, Arch, Ubuntu as my production desktop machine, and tried many others. I have used Gnome2, Gnome3, KDE, Fluxbox, Openbox, i3wm all as a production desktop at one point or another.

  After all those years I have settled on using the latest Ubuntu LTS, using the default Gnome3 DE. Prior to 18.04 LTS I was using Unity DE.

- **Gnome Terminal with Tmux**

  Don't use tmux within tmux. OUCH!!

  A significant part of my workflow involves using a terminal with tmux. It is rare for me to not have a tmux session when I am using a terminal.

- **VSCode**

  It started with using Geany. Then when Atom came out, I was a pretty dedicated Atom user from the start, as of early 2018 I switched to VSCode.

  I have also dabbled in the Vim world, but so far have not been tempted to make a permanent switch.

## Programming Languages

- **Ruby**

  The first programming book that I purchased was 'Javascript for Dummies' back in the early 2000's. Then I got an O'reilly Python book a few years later. I really like python. For years I wrote simple Python scripts, although nothing useful.

  In the early Ruby on Rails craze, I dabbled in Rails. Thats how I was introduced to Ruby. I like Ruby more than I like Rails. Since then I have purchased many books and online courses on Ruby, and find my self always reaching for Ruby first.

- **Javascript**

  In the last few years, I have liked using Vanilla JS. Because I can't write client side Ruby, I must use Javascript. But things are getting better in the JS world.

## Frameworks

- **Vuejs**

  This is the first framework I have fully committed to. I think its a framework that solves lot of problems I don't want to solve. Just the thought of the many different versions of browsers, all having slightly different specs. OUCH!!

  Vuejs + Babel + Webpack = :)

## Libraries

- **Sinatra**

  I have yet to do a full project in Rails. I can see in a really big project with many contributors that Rails would solve a lot of pain points.

  Until Sinatra becomes a problem because of scaling, its what I use.

- **Rspec**

  Umm... It make sense for me.

- **Sequel**

  This is one of my favorite Ruby gems. Simple, clean, and very powerful.

## Server

- **Debian & Ubuntu**

  My home server is usually on the latest Ubuntu LTS. If I go with a production server, its pretty much a toss up between Debian and Ubuntu LTS.

  I have played around with OpenBSD and FreeBSD as my home server. I had the time to learn a new OS, I would like to start using more OpenBSD.

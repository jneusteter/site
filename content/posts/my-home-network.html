	<h2>My Home Netork</h2>
	<p>
	  I have been on a mission to take full control of my home network. Not only control but amazing
    performance. This started about mid 2016. A network where I can control every device on the network,
    as in what time of the day it can access the netork or even which part of the network. This is a
    work in progress, so lets see where it takes me.
	</p>
	<p>
		But lets be clear, this is a lifetime project. There is always new technology coming out. There is
		always new hardware coming out. So I will be updating and upgrading as time goes on.
	</p>
	<h3>ISP</h3>
	<p>
		The ISP(Internet Service Provider) to me is there to simply provide a dumb pipe to the Internet.
		ISPs provide the copper from one node to the other. ISPs that do more is a bad thing. So at the very
		least I need a modem from them which I will connect to "MY" network.
	</p>
	<h3>Gateway</h3>
	<p>
		Gateways assume to know who is in charge to send your packet to other networks.
	</p>
	<h3>Router</h3>
	<p>
		A router takes a packet from one network to the other.
	</p>
	<h3>My Setup</h3>
	<p>
		Here is a rather crude drawing of my soon to be setup. I am still waiting for my
		hardware. Seems my choice of motherboard was rare, and it is on back order.

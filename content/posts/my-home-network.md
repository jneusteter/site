## My Home Netork

I have been on a mission to take full control of my home network. Not only control but amazing performance. This started about mid 2016. A network where I can control every device on the network, as in what time of the day it can access the netork or even which part of the network. This is a work in progress, so lets see where it takes me.

But lets be clear, this is a lifetime project. There is always new technology coming out. There is always new hardware coming out. So I will be updating and upgrading as time goes on.

### ISP

The ISP(Internet Service Provider) to me is there to simply provide a dumb pipe to the Internet. ISPs provide the copper from one node to the other. ISPs that do more is a bad thing. So at the very least I need a modem from them which I will connect to "MY" network.

### Gateway

Gateways assume to know who is in charge to send your packet to other networks.

### Router

A router takes a packet from one network to the other.

### My Setup

Here is a rather crude drawing of my soon to be setup. I am still waiting for my hardware. Seems my choice of motherboard was rare, and it is on back order.
